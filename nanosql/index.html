    <h2 class="pagetitle">NanoSQL: lightweight data mapper for SQLite</h2>
    <br />
    <p>NanoSQL is a small data mapper for Rust and SQLite. It allows you to quickly
    and type-safely define the schema of your database, while giving you full control
    over the SQL of your queries.</p>
    <p>It essentially removes the boilerplate associated with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Defining the types, constraints, and indexes of a table</li>
      <li>Compiling prepared statements and binding parameters to them</li>
      <li>Mapping the returned result set (rows) to a collection of domain objects</li>
      <li>Setting up the generally recommended configuration on an SQLite connection</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The library always tries to do the right thing by default. For instance:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Foreign keys are automatically indexed.</li>
      <li>Batch insertions are automatically wrapped in an <tt>IMMEDIATE</tt> transaction.</li>
      <li>When you are required to supply bare SQL expressions (for example, in <tt>CHECK</tt>
      constraints or <tt>GENERATED</tt> columns), derive macros ensure the syntactical validity
      of those expressions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While not a full ORM, NanoSQL does provide convenient helper types and functions
    for the most common tasks, such as creating tables, inserting rows, and looking up
    records by their primary key.</p>
    <p>The library is highly specific to SQLite, and as such, it can readily support most
    of its advanced features. For example, you can declare partial indexes, set WAL mode,
    and the output of <tt>EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN</tt> is readibly available as a pre-parsed,
    pretty-printed tree for you to perform debugging and performance optimization.</p>
