    <h2 class="pagetitle">SteelSafe: Personal password manager</h2>
    <br />
    <p>SteelSafe is a small, portable, offline, personal password manager written
    in 100% safe Rust that I started because I couldn't find anything similar that
    would be a perfect fit for my own needs.</p>
    <p>Its distinguishing features include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A local, easily-accessible, portable password database in SQLite format</li>
      <li>An easy-to-use, slick Terminal User Interface (TUI)</li>
      <li>Adherence to cryptography and software engineering best practices</li>
      <li>Zero-config by default with very few knobs to turn &emdash; no risk of setting weak parameters</li>
      <li>A reasonable threat model and the associated simplicity makes code review easy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To get started, see the <a href="https://github.com/H2CO3/steelsafe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official documentation on GitHub</a>.</p>
