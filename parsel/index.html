    <br />
    <p>If you have ever worked with parser generators or parsing libraries, you probably
    encountered some or all of the following problems:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>When using a parser generator, you needed to run a separate external executable,
      complicating your build process. You also needed to provide "parser actions" to
      manually construct AST nodes based on each individual production of the grammar.</li>
      <li>When using a parser combinator library, you still had to manually map the low-level
      parse trees returned by the combinator functions into high-level AST node types that
      you wanted to represent your grammar with.</li>
      <li>You had to manually keep track of the source location of each production, and add
      it to the corresponding AST node.</li>
      <li>The grammar required maintenance in two parallel places: changing the syntax
      required changing a production in the parser, as well as updating the representation
      of the AST types to match the new syntax.</li>
      <li>While parsing was adequately implemented by the tool or library you used, the
      reverse direction (serializing an AST as source code) was missing or poorly supported.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><tt>Parsel</tt> is a next-generation parsing library that <strong>solves all of these
    problems at once.</strong> Inspired by the Serde serialization framework, it provides
    procedural macros and a battery of AST helper types, which allow you to directly parse
    source code into AST nodes.</p>
    <p>No more manual mapping of productions to AST types. No more running of external binaries.
    No more manual walking of ASTs. No more worrying about operator precedence.</p>
